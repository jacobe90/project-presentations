# project-presentations
This repository contains presentations of projects I've undertaken over the years. Some folders contain supplementary videos; these videos were originally included within the presentation but did not parse when the presentation got converted to  a pdf. Projects documented within this repository include:

- **Applications of Ant Colony Optimization** (see [this repository](https://github.com/jacobe90/aco-applications) for code and  more details)
- **Bayesian Optimization For Birdflow Hyperparameter Tuning** The culmination of work during a Spring 2023 independent study with Professor Daniel Sheldon; a presentation detailing the results of using bayesian optimization to select hyperparameters for BirdFlow, a framework for generating probabilisitc models of bird migratory behavior. To learn more about the technical details of BirdFlow, see [this paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14052)! To try out BirdFlow for yourself, see [the BirdFlowR package](https://birdflow-science.github.io/BirdFlowR/articles/BirdFlowR.html).
- **Virtual Reality Pose Estimation for the Fetch Robot**: the product of my Summer '21 work at UMass Lowell's [Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Lab](https://www.uml-hri-lab.com/) and [NERVE Center](https://www.uml.edu/research/nerve/); a virtual reality interface for manually estimating and setting the pose of the Fetch robot
- **Operating Boston Dynamics' Spot In Virtual Reality**: a virtual reality interface for performing manipulation and navigation tasks with Boston Dynamics' Spot robot; the product of my Summer '22 work at UMass Lowell's HRI Lab
