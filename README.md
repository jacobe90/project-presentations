# project-presentations
This repository contains presentations of projects I've undertaken over the years. Some folders contain supplementary videos; these videos were originally included within the presentation but did not parse when the presentation got converted to  a pdf. Projects documented within this repository include:

- **Applications of Ant Colony Optimization** (see [this repository](https://github.com/jacobe90/aco-applications) for code and  more details)
- **Bayesian Optimization For Birdflow Hyperparameter Tuning** The culmination of work during a Spring 2023 independent study with Professor Daniel Sheldon; a presentation detailing the results of using bayesian optimization to select hyperparameters for BirdFlow, a framework for generating probabilisitc models of bird migratory behavior. To learn more about the technical details of BirdFlow, see [this paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14052)! To try out BirdFlow for yourself, see [the BirdFlowR package](https://birdflow-science.github.io/BirdFlowR/articles/BirdFlowR.html).
- **Mixture of Products** Work done during Summer / Fall 2023 on experimenting with a mixture of products model structure for birdflow, which enables modelling of long-range dependencies in bird migration paths, including site fidelity - birds' tendency to return to the same breeding locations every year. 
- **Virtual Reality Pose Estimation for the Fetch Robot**: the product of my Summer '21 work at UMass Lowell's [Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Lab](https://www.uml-hri-lab.com/) and [NERVE Center](https://www.uml.edu/research/nerve/); a virtual reality interface for manually estimating and setting the pose of the Fetch robot
- **Operating Boston Dynamics' Spot In Virtual Reality**: a virtual reality interface for performing manipulation and navigation tasks with Boston Dynamics' Spot robot; the product of my Summer '22 work at UMass Lowell's HRI Lab
- **SeasonWatch**: Presentations given during a Summer 2024 Fellowship with Public Interest Tech-New England. Worked with [SeasonWatch][], a nonprofit based in India which collects crowdsourced observations of trees, to analyze tree flowering and fruiting phenophases. We presented weekly to our collaborators at SeasonWatch, at the PIT-NE midpoint and community showcase presentations, and at an invited talk to SeasonWatch and citizen scientists. A sample weekly presentation, and the final showcase presentation, are attached here.
